  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.

    Title: FitTechPro: Your Personalized Fitness Trainer


    Summary:


    FitTechPro is a fitness application designed to offer personalized workouts with real-time pose detection technology,
    aimed at users with varying fitness goals. The application incorporates AI to provide feedback on exercise technique to
    ensure safety and effectiveness. Key features include personalized workouts, an exercise library with video demonstrations,
    progress tracking, virtual trainers, nutrition tracking, fitness community engagement, and compatibility with wearable
    devices.


    The onboarding process involves users creating a profile and specifying their goals and equipment. FitTechPro then creates
    personalized workout plans and uses the device''s camera for live feedback during workouts. Users'' progress is logged,
    and nutritional guidance is offered. The involvement of virtual trainers and community participation enriches the user
    experience.


    The application relies on two main scripts for its functionalities; ''PoseModule.py'' for pose detection, and a main script
    for tracking exercise repetitions and providing feedback. Both scripts include detailed coding in Python using OpenCV,
    MediaPipe, NumPy, and other libraries.


    The development of FitTechPro requires expertise in mobile app development, AI, pose detection, fitness tracking, and
    user interface design. The app is targeted for launch on both iOS and Android platforms and will support multiple languages.
    AI elements, possibly including OpenAI''s NLP models, will be used to automatically generate workout plans. At its launch,
    there is no specified list of wearable devices for compatibility.

    ```



    Here are the technologies that you need to use for this project:

    ```


    - Node.js


    - Express


    - React Native


    - TensorFlow.js


    - MobileNet


    - MongoDB


    - Mongoose


    - Redux


    - Socket.io


    - Bootstrap


    - HTML


    - CSS3


    - MediaPipe


    - NumPy


    - OpenCV-python


    - cronjob


    - React Navigation


    - i18next


    - Expo


    ```






    We''ve broken the development of this app down to these tasks:

    ```

    1. Set up the project structure for FitTechPro with React Native using Expo, and initialize a Git repository for version
    control.


    2. Implement the user authentication system with Node.js backend, including secure password handling, registration, login,
    and session management.


    3. Design the onboarding screens in React Native that capture user profile and fitness goals, and create the REST API
    to store this data in the MongoDB database.


    4. Build the exercise library interface in React Native with search and filtering capabilities and set up the MongoDB
    schema for storing exercises.


    5. Integrate TensorFlow.js with PoseModule.py script for real-time pose detection and create interface in React Native
    to display feedback during workouts.


    6. Develop the feature for personalized workout plan generation using AI algorithms, incorporating user data and goals.


    7. Implement progress tracking functionality with visualization for user performance over time and adjust workout plans
    accordingly.


    8. Create nutrition tracking features with dietary goals and feedback, linking to user profiles and workout plans.


    9. Implement virtual trainer interactions using Socket.io to deliver live feedback and coaching during workouts.


    10. Enable community engagement features where users can connect and share progress, with React Native screens and MongoDB
    schemas for user interactions.


    11. Add multi-language support with i18next integration in React Native to provide a localized experience in various languages.


    12. Develop functionality to synchronize data with wearable devices, including a cronjob for periodic updates.


    13. Finalize touch-ups on the user interface design to ensure consistent branding with Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS3 across
    React Native components.


    ```


    You are currently working on task #1 with the following description:

    ```

    Set up the project structure for FitTechPro with React Native using Expo, and initialize a Git repository for version
    control.

    ```


    After all the code is finished, a human developer will check if the app works this way - `Ensure that the Expo project
    starts without errors and a ''Welcome to FitTechPro'' screen is displayed on the Expo Go app.`


    Now, tell me all the code that needs to be written to implement ONLY this task and have it fully working and all commands
    that need to be run to implement this task.


    **IMPORTANT**

    When you think about in which file should the new code go to, always try to make files as small as possible and put code
    in more smaller files rather than in one big file. Whenever a file becomes too large (more than 50 lines of code) split
    it into smaller files.


    **IMPORTANT**

    Remember, I created an empty folder where I will start writing files that you tell me and that are needed for this app.

    You do not need to make any automated tests work.


    DO NOT specify commands to create any folders or files, they will be created automatically - just specify the relative
    path to each file that needs to be written.


    Never use the port 5000 to run the app, it''s reserved.'

  content: "To accomplish task #1, you will need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Install Expo CLI globally on your machine\
    \ (if not already installed).\n\n```sh\nnpm install -g expo-cli\n```\n\n2. Create a new React Native app using Expo.\n\
    \n```sh\nexpo init FitTechPro\n```\n\nWhen prompted, choose a blank template or a minimal template that suits React Native\
    \ projects. This command will create a new directory named `FitTechPro` with all necessary files and folders.\n\n3. Navigate\
    \ into the newly created project directory.\n\n```sh\ncd FitTechPro\n```\n\n4. Initialize a new Git repository.\n\n```sh\n\
    git init\n```\n\n5. Create a simple welcome screen. You will need to edit the default App.js file created by Expo with\
    \ your welcome message. Your `App.js` should look like this:\n\n```jsx\n// FitTechPro/App.js\n\nimport React from 'react';\n\
    import { StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <View style={styles.container}>\n\
    \      <Text>Welcome to FitTechPro</Text>\n    </View>\n  );\n}\n\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n\
    \    flex: 1,\n    backgroundColor: '#fff',\n    alignItems: 'center',\n    justifyContent: 'center',\n  },\n});\n```\n\
    \n6. Start the Expo development server to check if the application runs correctly and displays the welcome message.\n\n\
    ```sh\nexpo start\n```\n\nThis command will open a Metro Bundler in your default web browser. You can then either run\
    \ the app in an emulator or scan the QR code with your mobile device using the Expo Go app.\n\n7. After verifying that\
    \ the app works as desired, make an initial commit to the Git repository.\n\n```sh\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Initial\
    \ commit with Expo project setup and welcome screen\"\n```\n\nThese steps will set up your React Native project using\
    \ the Expo framework, and a Git repository for version control. The welcome message will be displayed on the Expo Go app\
    \ when the development server is running, fulfilling the programmatic goal of task #1. \n\nNext steps will involve branching\
    \ and feature development, but for this task, setting up the base project structure and adding a welcome message are all\
    \ that's required."

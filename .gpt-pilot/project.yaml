description: 'Title: FitTechPro: Your Personalized Fitness Trainer


  Summary:


  FitTechPro is a fitness application designed to offer personalized workouts with real-time pose detection technology, aimed
  at users with varying fitness goals. The application incorporates AI to provide feedback on exercise technique to ensure
  safety and effectiveness. Key features include personalized workouts, an exercise library with video demonstrations, progress
  tracking, virtual trainers, nutrition tracking, fitness community engagement, and compatibility with wearable devices.


  The onboarding process involves users creating a profile and specifying their goals and equipment. FitTechPro then creates
  personalized workout plans and uses the device''s camera for live feedback during workouts. Users'' progress is logged,
  and nutritional guidance is offered. The involvement of virtual trainers and community participation enriches the user experience.


  The application relies on two main scripts for its functionalities; ''PoseModule.py'' for pose detection, and a main script
  for tracking exercise repetitions and providing feedback. Both scripts include detailed coding in Python using OpenCV, MediaPipe,
  NumPy, and other libraries.


  The development of FitTechPro requires expertise in mobile app development, AI, pose detection, fitness tracking, and user
  interface design. The app is targeted for launch on both iOS and Android platforms and will support multiple languages.
  AI elements, possibly including OpenAI''s NLP models, will be used to automatically generate workout plans. At its launch,
  there is no specified list of wearable devices for compatibility.'

development_plan:
- description: Set up the project structure for FitTechPro with React Native using Expo, and initialize a Git repository for
    version control.
  programmatic_goal: Initialize a React Native project with Expo, ensure a successful build on a local development machine,
    and push the initial commit to the Git repository.
  user_review_goal: Ensure that the Expo project starts without errors and a 'Welcome to FitTechPro' screen is displayed on
    the Expo Go app.
- description: Implement the user authentication system with Node.js backend, including secure password handling, registration,
    login, and session management.
  programmatic_goal: Create REST API endpoints for user registration and login that interfaces with MongoDB, complete with
    JWT based session management.
  user_review_goal: Verify that users can register with validation feedback and, once registered, can log in and out with
    persistent sessions.
- description: Design the onboarding screens in React Native that capture user profile and fitness goals, and create the REST
    API to store this data in the MongoDB database.
  programmatic_goal: Develop React Native screens for the onboarding process with form validation and ensure the REST API
    for profile data creation and updating is working with the database.
  user_review_goal: Confirm the onboarding process captures user information correctly and the user profile is created and
    retrievable via the app.
- description: Build the exercise library interface in React Native with search and filtering capabilities and set up the
    MongoDB schema for storing exercises.
  programmatic_goal: Implement the client-side exercise library interface and server-side REST API for listing, searching,
    and filtering exercises stored in MongoDB.
  user_review_goal: Ensure that the exercise library is user-friendly, searchable, and filters work correctly, with all data
    presented accurately.
- description: Integrate TensorFlow.js with PoseModule.py script for real-time pose detection and create interface in React
    Native to display feedback during workouts.
  programmatic_goal: Embed TensorFlow.js and PoseModule.py within the React Native environment to successfully receive real-time
    pose detection data, and develop the UI component to display pose correctness feedback.
  user_review_goal: Check if the app can analyze user poses in real-time during workouts with visual feedback reflected accurately
    on the interface.
- description: Develop the feature for personalized workout plan generation using AI algorithms, incorporating user data and
    goals.
  programmatic_goal: Code an AI module that generates personalized workout plans based on user data, and integrate this feature
    with the backend and frontend.
  user_review_goal: Evaluate the effectiveness of personalized workout plans by confirming they align with users' specified
    fitness goals and preferences.
- description: Implement progress tracking functionality with visualization for user performance over time and adjust workout
    plans accordingly.
  programmatic_goal: Create necessary REST API endpoints and frontend components for logging and visualizing workout data,
    and ensure dynamic adjustments to workout plans are functional based on user progress.
  user_review_goal: Confirm that the progress tracking displays accurate workout data over time with intuitive charts and
    that workout plans are being adjusted based on user performance.
- description: Create nutrition tracking features with dietary goals and feedback, linking to user profiles and workout plans.
  programmatic_goal: Develop the data models for nutrition tracking, the corresponding REST API endpoints, and the React Native
    components for users to input and track their dietary habits.
  user_review_goal: Verify that users can log nutritional intake, set dietary goals, and receive relevant feedback integrated
    with their workout plans.
- description: Implement virtual trainer interactions using Socket.io to deliver live feedback and coaching during workouts.
  programmatic_goal: Integrate Socket.io to enable real-time communication between the client and the virtual trainers on
    the server, and code the client-side interface for live interactions.
  user_review_goal: Assess the virtual trainer feature by ensuring that users receive live feedback and coaching during workouts
    with minimal latency.
- description: Enable community engagement features where users can connect and share progress, with React Native screens
    and MongoDB schemas for user interactions.
  programmatic_goal: Create the necessary MongoDB structure for storing community interactions and develop the React Native
    UI for community engagement with backend support.
  user_review_goal: Test community features to ensure users can connect, share progress, and interact with other users' profiles
    without issues.
- description: Add multi-language support with i18next integration in React Native to provide a localized experience in various
    languages.
  programmatic_goal: Implement i18next in the React Native app to support multiple languages, ensuring all text can be appropriately
    localized from a JSON resource file.
  user_review_goal: Confirm that users can switch languages, and the app's UI reflects this change correctly across all screens.
